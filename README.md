# Olympiad Math Hub (Olimpiadinės matematikos svetainė)

---

## Project Overview

The **Olympiad Math Hub** is a free, accessible, and comprehensive web platform designed to empower aspiring mathematics olympiad learners across Lithuania. Built with modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), this project aims to bridge the gap in high-quality, Lithuanian-language educational resources for competitive mathematics, particularly for younger students who often find English-language materials too challenging or conceptually distant.

This platform serves as a central hub for theory, categorized practice problems across all four mathematical spheres (Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, and Combinatorics), and a vibrant community forum.

## The Backstory: A Passion for Problem-Solving and Community

This project was born from a personal realization ignited by volunteer work. While tutoring children of various ages in small groups at a local library multiple times a week, I witnessed firsthand the transformative power of mentorship. Helping children gain confidence and improve academically not only boosted their results but also significantly honed my own communication and leadership skills.

However, during this experience, a critical need became glaringly apparent: students across Lithuania, driven by a desire to explore mathematics more deeply, often lacked quality, accessible resources in their native language. For younger learners, existing English-language materials were frequently too advanced or culturally detached.

This insight sparked a mission: to create a free, user-friendly, and culturally relevant platform for beginner Olympiad learners. The goal was to provide a structured environment where theory could be grasped easily, and problems could be tackled systematically.

## Key Features

* **Comprehensive Theory Guides:** Clear and concise explanations of fundamental mathematical concepts relevant to olympiad competitions.
* **Categorized Problem Sets:** A curated collection of practice problems, meticulously organized by mathematical sphere (Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Combinatorics) and potentially by difficulty level, allowing for targeted practice.
* **Interactive Community Forum (Discord Integration):** Recognizing the power of collaborative learning, the platform seamlessly integrates with a dedicated Discord server. This serves as the dynamic forum where:
    * Over 120 active users (and growing!) engage in real-time discussions.
    * Members ask questions, share insights, and collaboratively solve challenging problems.
    * A supportive and vibrant Lithuanian community of learners fosters mutual growth and passion for mathematics.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, intuitive design with a built-in dark mode toggle for comfortable viewing.
* **Pure Static Web Technologies:** Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring lightweight, fast-loading pages and easy deployment.
